    "### 1.1 Vector Space Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space search involves converting documents into vectors, where each dimension within the vectors represents a term. VSMs represent embedded words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points. \n",

    "#### 1.1.1 Distributional Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector Space Model methods depend highly on the Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that appear in the same contexts share semantic meaning. The different approaches that leverage this principle can be divided into two categories: count-based methods and predictive methods. \n",

    "#### 1.1.2 Stemming & Stop Words\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin implementing a Vector Space Model, first you must get all terms within documents and clean them. A tool you will likely utilize for this process is a stemmer, takes words and reduces them to the unchanging portion. Words which have a common stem often have similar meanings, which is why you'd likely want to utilize a stemmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also want to remove any stopwords, such as a, am, an, also ,any, and, etc. Stop words have little value in this search so it's better that we just get rid of them. \n",

    "### 1.2 Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a type of neural network designed for dimensionality reduction; in other words, representing the same information with fewer numbers. A wide range of autoencoder architectures exist, including Denoising Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, or Sequence Autoencoders. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic premise is simple — we take a neural network and train it to spit out the same information it’s given. By doing so, we ensure that the activations of each layer must, by definition, be able to represent the entirety of the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 How do Autencoders work? \n",
    "\n",
    "If each layer is the same size as the input, this becomes trivial, and the data can simply be copied over from layer to layer to the output. But if we start changing the size of the layers, the network inherently learns a new way to represent the data. If the size of one of the hidden layers is smaller than the input data, it has no choice but to find some way to compress the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s exactly what an autoencoder does. The network starts out by “compressing” the data into a lower-dimensional representation, and then converts it back to a reconstruction of the original input. If the network converges properly, it will be a more compressed version of the data that encodes the same information. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s often helpful to think about the network as an “encoder” and a “decoder”. The first half of the network, the encoder, takes the input and transforms it into the lower-dimensional representation. The decoder then takes that lower-dimensional representation and converts it back to the original image (or as close to it as it can get). The encoder and decoder are still trained together, but once we have the weights, we can use the two separately — maybe we use the encoder to generate a more meaningful representation of some data we’re feeding into another neural network, or the decoder to let the network generate new data we haven’t shown it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 Why are Autoencoders Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some of your features may be redundant or correlated, you can end up with wasted processing time and an overfitted model - Autoencoders help us avoid that."

    "### 1.3 Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Like an autoencoder, this type of model learns a vector space embedding for some data. For tasks like speech recognition we know that all the information required to successfully perform the task is encoded in the data. However, natural language processing systems traditionally treat words as discrete atomic symbols, and therefore 'cat' may be represented as Id537 and 'dog' as Id143. These encodings are arbitrary, and provide no useful information to the system regarding the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the model can leverage very little of what it has learned about 'cats' when it is processing data about 'dogs' (such that they are both animals, four-legged, pets, etc.). Representing words as unique, discrete IDs furthermore leads to data sparsity, and usually means that we may need more data in order to successfully train statistical models. However, using vector representations can overcome some of these obstacles.\n",

    "### 1.4 Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is an efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. It comes in two models: the <b>Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW)</b> and the <b>Skip-Gram model</b>. Algorithmically, these models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words (e.g. 'mat') from source context words ('the cat sits on the'), while the skip-gram does the inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to think about word2vec is that it figures out how to place words on a graph in such a way that their location is determined by their meaning. In other words, words with similar meanings will be clustered together. More interestingly, though, is that the gaps and distances on the graph have meaning as well. So if you go to where “king” appears, and move the same distance and direction between “man” and “woman”, you end up where “queen” appears. And this is true of all kinds of semantic relationships! You can look at this visualization [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/images/linear-relationships.png).\n",
    "\n",

    "Tensors are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors.

    "A Graph contains operations and tensors. You can use multiple graphs in your program, but most programs only need a single graph. You can use the same graph in multiple sessions, but not multiple graphs in one session. TensorFlow always creates a default graph, but you may also create a graph manually and set it as the new default.
